                    Hi there! My name is GauravPandey, and I am a passionate and dedicated developer with 1 year of experience in
                    HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, PYTHON, Bootstrap. <br><br>

                    My strengths include ' problem solving' , 'leadership' , 'communication', 'corporative behavior', etc. I
                    am a team player who enjoys collaborating with others to achieve project goals and deliver high-quality

                    In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth. I am also
                    good in 'DSA' , ' C', 'C++' , 'JAVA' programming languages. I am always eager to take on new challenges
                    and push myself to become a better developer. Whether it's through attending conferences, participating
